# RolandV-1HD-Arduino-TallyLights
A Tally light system for the Roland V-1HD Video switcher using Arduino, MIDI, and DTMF

Intro
I bought this Roland V-1HD during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic when many gatherings were going online. I chose this one because it was in stock (many video systems went out of stock in early 2020) and it has a T-bar switcher, a staple of old-school video switching systems like Grass Valley switchers made infamous in Star Wars as the firing mechanism for the Death Star. 

In a multi-camera system its important for the talent to know which camera to look towards, and broadcast cameras have something called a Tally Light, a red light that goes on when that camera is live.  This project set out to use the Roland V-1HD's Midi output to build a Tally Light system
